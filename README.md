# Disbot-VIP-Strelitzia

This README is still working in process and will be updated along the development proceeds.

## Introduction

Idea originated from [this post](https://qiita.com/peisuke/items/80984db8b47cd8243019) by [@peisuke](https://github.com/peisuke). The idea is to create a 5ch like channel in Slack where people can post anonymously. The original project is for Slack in a company which the motivation for that is explained in the Qiita post (in Japanese).

This project however, is in a simliar approach but is to build the same thing for Discord. And it is purely for fun.

## Packages Used

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
- [Object-hash](https://github.com/puleos/object-hash)
- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)

## License
