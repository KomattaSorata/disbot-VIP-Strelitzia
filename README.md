# Disbot-VIP-Strelitzia

This README is still working in process and will be updated along the development proceeds.
\*\* Minor progress is on another private repo.

## Introduction

Idea originated from [this post](https://qiita.com/peisuke/items/80984db8b47cd8243019) by [@peisuke](https://github.com/peisuke). The idea is to create a 5ch like channel in Slack where people can post anonymously. The original project is for Slack in a company which the motivation for that is explained in the Qiita post (in Japanese).

This project however, is in a simliar approach but is to build the same thing for Discord. And it is purely for fun.

## To-dos

(The upcoming versions will have "thread limitation", where number of replies are limited and a reset will be performed when the limit is reached. This is for monitoring the impact minor changes made, both on performances and how users use the board.)

- Allowing direct upload of images, including GIF support.
- Adding MongoDB for action log and content saving.
- Allowing the regeneration of postingid (will replace current hash method, new hash method will not be publicly committed)
- Basic admin feature from DMing the bot will be added.

## License

This project is based on MIT, I don't exactly know what that mean but yes we can talk about it if any idea are given. Thank you.
